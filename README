Slip days
=======================================================
We will be using one of our remaining slip days.


FILES
========================================================
lab3b.py: Our main source code that analyzes the file system summaries generated from our lab3a.c code. The main objective of this code is to discover any inconsistencies and report it to stdout. 

Makefile: 
	dist ... create the deliverable tarball
	clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile.

	Since we used python, there is no default target to build in our Makefile. Instead, we have a shell script called lab3b 
	(executable) that takes in one csv file as an argument and runs it with lab3b.py file.

README: Include partner's name, email and UID. Also described the various include files. Listed multiple references that aided us with our project development.
